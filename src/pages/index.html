{{!--
  This is the main HTML page.

  Header and footer partials are added to get started.
  Any other files needed can be added to the assets directory,
  which will be copied over directly including directories.

  The message variable is inherited from global variables
  in the data.json file. Page specific variables have
  the same name as a page file including the extension.
  Page specific variables will override global variables.

  This comment will not be output in the final build.
